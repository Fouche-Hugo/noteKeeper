# noteKeeper

NoteKeeper is a project I decided to do to improve my web skills. It was made in HTML, SCSS, PHP and Javascript (with Vue JS). The principle is simple, it's just a website where you can register and record notes with several basic features like changing the text colour, the note background...

I also tried to add other features like a night mode and to stay connected to the site with cookies.
The design and the code were made by me 100%. Here is what the site looks like https://notekeeper.fouche-hugo.fr/
